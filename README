NAME
    iosdiff - Cisco IOS Config Diff Utility

VERSION
    version 1.112140

SYNOPSIS
     $> iosdiff 192.0.2.1 192.0.2.1.new

     ~~~ Config diff for device 192.0.2.1
     ===================================================================
     - snmp-server enable traps ccme
     + snmp-server enable traps srst

DESCRIPTION
    The "iosdiff" program will intelligently diff two files which are in
    Cisco IOS-style configuration file format.

    Whilst an ordinary diff works on IOS-style configuration files, it
    doesn't show the context in a useful way. For example if one line
    changes within an interface configuration, you're likely not to see the
    interface name in a standard 3-line contextual diff. This program
    improves that by showing the full context of any difference.

    In terms of IOS-style configuration, this context means either the
    "section" such as an interface or class-map (a header with indented
    lines), or the command group such as an access control list, where the
    lines share common leading text.

USAGE
    The "iosdiff" command takes only two arguments, which are the names of
    the two files to diff.

     $> iosdiff from_this_file to_this_file

    Lines in the files which are comments (begin with ""!"") will be
    stripped from the file before the comparison is made.

  Options
    "-B"
        Use this option to *suppress* the banner which is printed before the
        diff output. Of course, no banner is printed anyway if there's no
        difference between the two files being compared. The banner looks
        like:

         ~~~ Config diff for device 192.0.2.1
         ===================================================================

        The device name in the banner depends on the name of the "right
        hand" file provided for comparing (that is, the second file name
        passed in the command line arguments). If there's an IP in the file
        name, it is resolved to a host name using the DNS and printed.
        Otherwise the IP is used, but if there's no IP then the file name
        itself is used.

         $> iosdiff -B from_this_file to_this_file
